//      or sit within ALLOW_GAP bytes of each other are merged into a single physical read.
//   2. PrepareReads() finalizes the merged list and allocates one libstf buffer per merged range
//      (no IO).
//   3. ExecuteMergedRead(idx) issues the single host read for merged range `idx`. These reads are
//      independent and may run concurrently (e.g. on DuckDB's async thread pool).

// Registration/preparation is single-threaded (each worker owns its own fetcher). Once
